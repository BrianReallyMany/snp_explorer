motivation: current target is to read in a file of taro snps, define a group of samples, then remove all snps but those which are homozygous and consistent within the group (allowing for a certain number of no-calls) but homozygous and different within the out-group (again allowing for a certain number of no-calls, but not allowing for any matches or heterozygous calls).

passing snps would then be written to a new file.

so, steps: remove all snps which contain any heterozygous bases whatsoever. next pass, check each snp for (a) all calls within group are equal or no-call, and #no-calls < N ... (b) all calls within out-group are NOT equal to group call and #no-calls <M.

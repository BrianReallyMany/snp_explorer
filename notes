motivation: current target is to read in a file of taro snps, define a group of samples, then remove all snps but those which are homozygous and consistent within the group (allowing for a certain number of no-calls) but homozygous and different within the out-group (again allowing for a certain number of no-calls, but not allowing for any matches or heterozygous calls).

passing snps would then be written to a new file.

so, steps: remove all snps which contain any heterozygous bases whatsoever. next pass, check each snp for (a) all calls within group are equal or no-call, and #no-calls < N ... (b) all calls within out-group are NOT equal to group call and #no-calls <M.

methods needed:

X snp.contains_heterozygous_call
X --> call.heterozygous

snp.consistent_within_group(group)

snp.fewer_than_n_no-calls_within_group(group, n)

...that plus some way to complement the group (maybe group belongs to vcf, or just to controller?) would do it.
...on second thought, better to explicitly define in-group and out-group, since within a given vcf there may be plenty of samples which are not of interest at all -- i.e. a no-call from a certain sample shouldn't count because we're not concerned with it. it'd still be useful to be able to define the out-group as the complement of the in-group though...
...change the wording from "fewer than n no-calls" to "at least n calls" and we have that functionality within group.
also have call.heterozygous, so snp.contains_heterozygous_call is trivial.
also also have snp.get_calls_from_group, so consistent within group shouldn't be real tough...
shibar, we are almost there. then need controller and console, plus functions to read and write vcf and we are cherry.
